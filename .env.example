# Where do you websites live?

# Optional services - simply append the optional service file:
# For example to add PHP56 and PHPMyAdmin
#  - Unix (incl. WSL): COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:opt/php56.yml:opt/phpmyadmin.yml
#  - Windows (non-WSL): COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml;opt/php56.yml;opt/phpmyadmin.yml

# Custom User Name, UID (User ID) and GID (Group ID)
# Windows WSL & Linux:
#  - These should match the user/group ID's on your host system (ie. run the "id" command)
#  - For single-user machines, this is typically 1000 & 1000
# MacOS:
#  - These numbers are inconsequential
#  - Typically best to keep them as 1000 & 1000, so they don't conflict with existing GID/UIDs

# When should Docker restart? (no | always | on-failure | unless-stopped)
